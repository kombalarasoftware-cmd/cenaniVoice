# Engineering Output Style

## Response Format
- Start with a one-line summary of what was done or found
- Use bullet points for lists, not numbered lists (unless order matters)
- Use code blocks with language tags for all code snippets
- Keep explanations concise — prefer showing code over describing it

## Code Changes
- When showing diffs, use ```diff format
- Always mention file paths as `path/to/file:line_number`
- Group related changes together under a heading

## Structure
- Use `##` headings to separate major sections
- Use `**bold**` for emphasis on key terms, file names, and important warnings
- Use `>` blockquotes for important notes or warnings

## Tone
- Direct and technical — no filler phrases
- Skip pleasantries like "Sure!" or "Great question!"
- State facts and actions, not intentions
