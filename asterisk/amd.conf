;
; Answering Machine Detection Configuration
; Optimized for Turkish/European phone networks
;
; How AMD works:
;   1. AMD listens to the audio after the call is answered
;   2. If silence lasts longer than initial_silence → MACHINE
;   3. If a short greeting + silence → HUMAN (person finished talking)
;   4. If greeting is too long or too many words → MACHINE (recorded msg)
;   5. total_analysis_time is the hard cap for analysis duration
;
; Key trade-off: higher initial_silence = fewer false positives on humans
;                but longer delay before AI starts talking
;

[general]
; Maximum time (ms) for AMD analysis. After this, result is NOTSURE.
; Reduced from 5000 to 3500 — faster decision, less delay for the caller.
total_analysis_time = 3500

; Silence threshold (0–32767). Below this = silence.
silence_threshold = 256

; --- Greeting Detection ---
; Max silence before greeting starts. If exceeded → MACHINE
; IMPORTANT: This was 2500 and caused false MACHINE detection when
; humans took 2-3 seconds to say "Alo" on unknown numbers.
; Increased to 3500 to give humans enough time to speak.
initial_silence = 3500

; Silence after greeting ends. If exceeded → HUMAN (person finished speaking)
after_greeting_silence = 800

; Max greeting length (ms). If exceeded → MACHINE (long recorded message)
; Increased from 1500 to 3000 — Turkish greetings can be 2+ seconds.
greeting = 3000

; --- Word Detection ---
; Min duration of voice to count as a word
min_word_length = 100

; Max duration of a single utterance
maximum_word_length = 5000

; Silence between words to separate them
between_words_silence = 50

; Max words in greeting. If exceeded → MACHINE
; Increased from 3 to 5 — humans may say "Alo, buyurun, kimsiniz?" etc.
maximum_number_of_words = 5
